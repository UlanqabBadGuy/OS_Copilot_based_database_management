Let's start by writing a Python script to download the stock price data for AAPL and META. We will save this script as `download_stock_data.py`. Let's create this script.

In the script above, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from Alpha Vantage. This script will download the stock price data for AAPL and META and save it to JSON files. Let's save this script as `download_stock_data.py` and run it.

It seems I am still facing issues with the file path. The script is not found in the expected location. Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Check File Location**: Ensure that the `download_stock_data.py` script is in the correct directory `/home/charlie/OS-Copilot/working_dir`.
2. **Verify File Name**: Double-check the file name to ensure it is correct.
3. **Manually Run Script**: Manually navigate to the correct directory and run the script using the Python interpreter.

If you can confirm the script's location and name, I can provide the next steps to proceed.
